## Proposal 1
*Next Page*<br>
**Inspiration**:  Saw at church that the pianist would occasionally have another musician turn the page. <br>
>Web App/Mobile Web App that accesses the devices' microphone, takes a PDF of a music sheet (or multiple PDFs), creates a decider on when to flip the page, and once the user triggers the unique signal then the music sheet automatically turns the page.
>
**Target Audience**: *Musicians that consistently practice and perform.*
> We appreciate music and some of us have an understanding of how to play an instrument, but collectively, we do not consider ourselves as musicians. 
> **Martin**: Played trumpet, mainly to keep my parents happy and get some scholarships. 
> **Ryan**: Played flute, and now, has no idea where it is.
> **Kai-ling**: 
> **Roy**:
